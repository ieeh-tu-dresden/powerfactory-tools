    abstract = {As the amount of volatile, renewable energy sources in power distribution grids is increasing, the stability of the latter is a vital aspect for grid operators. Within the STABEEL project, the authors develop rules on how to parametrize the reactive power control of distributed energy resources to increase the performance while guaranteeing stability. The work focuses on distribution grids with a high penetration of distributed energy resources equipped with Q(V)-characteristic. This contribution is based on the stability assessment of previous work and introduces a new approach utilizing the circle criterion. With the aim of extending existing technical guidelines, stability assessment methods are applied to various distribution grids (e. g. benchmark grids). Herein, distributed energy resources can be modelled as detailed control loops or as approximations, derived from technical guidelines.}

    abstract = { The energy transition has resulted in the integration of power-intensive consumers and producers into low voltage grids. This has led to an increased load on these grids, which may reach their capacity limits and thus necessitate grid expansions. However, grid expansions cannot be completed in a short-term period due to various limitations. The project DIGITECHNETZ focuses on the digital transformation of low voltage grids and proposes different use cases for an active grid management. The core component of this project is a data platform that provides essential services for active grid operation. The platform is designed with a modular and hierarchical structure to ensure interoperability and scalability. All use cases are developed and validated using Hardware-in-the-Loop tests. Subsequently, field tests are conducted to seamlessly integrate selected use cases into the operation schemes of grid operators. }
