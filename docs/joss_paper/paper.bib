    abstract = {As the amount of volatile, renewable energy sources in power distribution grids is increasing, the stability of the latter is a vital aspect for grid operators. Within the STABEEL project, the authors develop rules on how to parametrize the reactive power control of distributed energy resources to increase the performance while guaranteeing stability. The work focuses on distribution grids with a high penetration of distributed energy resources equipped with Q(V)-characteristic. This contribution is based on the stability assessment of previous work and introduces a new approach utilizing the circle criterion. With the aim of extending existing technical guidelines, stability assessment methods are applied to various distribution grids (e. g. benchmark grids). Herein, distributed energy resources can be modelled as detailed control loops or as approximations, derived from technical guidelines.},
